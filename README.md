# Pyong

A simple "paddle and ball" game in the spirit of pong. Written in Python with a Tkinter GUI.<br><br>
Target runtime is Python 3 or later, to play just execute your system's call.<br>
i.e. `python game.py` or `python3 game.py`<br><br>
Premise of the game is to bounce the ball off the wall (top of canvas) with your paddle. Don't mess up.<br><br>
